  PostHog Test Utilities Module

  PostHog makes it simple to test captured events. Make sure to set `test_mode` in your `config/test.exs`:

  ```
  config :posthog, 
    test_mode: true
  ```

  Now PostHog will not send your captured events to the server and will instead
  keep them in memory, easily accessible for assertions:

  ```
  test "capture event" do
    PostHog.capture("event", %{distinct_id: "distinct_id"})

    assert [event] = PostHog.Test.all_captured()

    assert %{
              event: "event",
              distinct_id: "distinct_id",
              properties: %{},
              timestamp: _
            } = event
  end
  ```

  ## Concurrency

  PostHog uses a powerful `NimbleOwnership` ownership mechanism to determine
  which events belong to which tests. This should work very well for most tests.

  However, in some cases captured events cannot be traced back to tests. Those
  tests are usually well-known and are run with `async: false` mode. For those,
  PostHog lets you enable "global" or "shared" mode, where _all_ events captured
  within the system will be accessible by the test.

  To switch PostHog to shared mode, just call `PostHog.Test.set_posthog_shared/1`
  in your setup:

  ```
  defmodule MyTest do
    use ExUnit.Case, async: false
    
    setup_all {PostHog.Test, :set_posthog_shared}
    
    test "complex test" do
      # run some code
      assert events = PostHog.Test.all_captured()
      assert Enum.any?(events, & match?(%{event: "my event"}, &1))
    end
  end
  ```

  PostHog will revert back from shared mode to private once the test suite or test
  process exits.

  Allows a process to share captured events with another process.

  Imagine that your test spawns an asynchronous process that captures an event.
  By default, the test process won't be able to access this event. To mitigate this,
  the test process should explicitly _allow_ the spawned process' events to appear in
  its own personal stash of captured events.

  ```
  test "allowance" do
    test_pid = self()

    pid =
